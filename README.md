    ## :book: Node Types in `data.yml` :book:

    The `data.yml` file contains the definitions for the various node types used in the
    data processing pipeline. These node types are represented under the `stepTypes:`
    section of the `data.yml` file.

    Node types include:

    - Source :fountain:
    - View :eyeglasses:
    - Dimension :triangular_ruler:
    - and others... :bulb:

    Refer to the `data.yml` file for the specific definitions and configurations
    for each node type.
